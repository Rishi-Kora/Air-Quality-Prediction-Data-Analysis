# Air-Quality-Prediction-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data using a dataset named city_day.csv. The project involves the following steps:<br>

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:<br>

Loading the air quality dataset into a pandas DataFrame.<br>

Exploring the dataset's structure using functions like head(), tail(), and info().<br>

Handling missing values by removing rows with missing data.<br>

Performing data scaling and normalization using StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and zscore.<br>

Removing outliers using the IQR method.<br>

2. Data Visualization:<br>

Creating histograms to visualize the distribution of key pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3).<br>

Generating a correlation matrix using a heatmap to visualize relationships between pollutants.<br>

Using pair plots to further explore the relationships between pollutants.<br>

Feel free to download the code and data.
